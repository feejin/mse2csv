# MSE 2 CSV

In lieu of a proper export feature in [Magic Set Editor](http://magicseteditor.sourceforge.net), this chews up the MSE HTML spoiler format and spits it back out as tab separated text, ready to drop into your favourite spreadsheet application.

Only tested with my MSE setup, YMMV.

## Disclaimer

This code is most likely horrible.
